                <p>There are several reasons I have cancelled these projects, for GEMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know C worth a hoot.
<ul>
<li>Neither does Oklomsy, the only contributor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do, however, somewhat know C#</li>
<li>Cross compilers don't like third party libraries.
<ul>
<li>Even ones with the same architecture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And, as for SwitchJoy, the web standards are a moving target, and to maintain it we would have to be working every month until we die on it, or we would have to have several more contributors, and let them work on it.</p>
<p>If you want to continue development on either of these projects, they are on <a href="https://github.com/sparksammy">my GitHub</a>, so feel free to fork and improve.</p>
